# Hashmap-based Department Report System
## Project Overview
The Department Report System facilitates the extraction of departmental data from CSV files, including details about departments, employees, and their salaries. It employs HashMaps to streamline data management and optimize performance. <br>

## Domain Objects <br>
### Department <br>
Markup : * **deptCode**: String
Markup : * **deptName**: String
Markup : * **depTotalSalary**: Double <br>

### Employee <br>
Markup : * **empNo**: String
Markup : * **lastName**: String
Markup : * **lastName**: String
Markup : * **salary**: Double <br>

_You need to create objects that will handle the retrieval of the csv files to convert it into objects.  These are EmployeeDA and EmployeeDA objects._

## INSTRUCTIONS:
Markup : 1. You are not allowed to alter the composition of the domain objects.  Stick to the design. Disregard the data in the csv if it is not necessary to the object.
Markup : 2. Adhere to correct naming conventions in naming variables and objects. 
Markup : 3. Use hashmap as your solution to the problem.
Markup : 4. Use the department.setDepTotalSalary() in putting the aggregated value into the object.  Do not just use the salary accumulation approach in the printing process to get the depTotalSalary.
